<hr>
<p>It was in about 1930 that radio antennas could first be seen on homes in Palestine and sets went on sale in city stores. At first the only stations to be heard were distant ones, by short-wave from Europe such as Radio Paris and BBC Empire Service, and medium wave from Cairo.
<br>At the Levant Fair in Tel Aviv the very first radio station goes on-air operated by Mendel Abramovitch under a special license from the British Mandatory Government. It went on air with a speech by Abramovitch and remarks from Tel Aviv Mayor Meir Dizengoff including an expression of hope that the station would be expanded to reach a worldwide Jewish audience.

<br>The first clandestine radio station opens which is operated by an underground Jewish group. Each of the main groups eventually operate stations but most activity is after the Second World War. A history of Jewish underground radio stations by broadcasting historian Professor Douglas Boyd.
<br>Israeli independence is proclaimed and Kol Israel (The Voice of Israel) starts broadcasting. Kol Israel becomes a government department first under the Ministry of the Interior, the Office of Posts and Telegraphs and subsequently under the Prime Minister's Office.

<hr>
<p>Radio in Israel can be divided into two categuries: public Broadcasting and commercial broadcasters. the first is funded and regulated by the <a class="linkcolor" href="https://www.kan.org.il/" target="_blank">Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation</a>
and the later by private opretors and its being regulated and supervised by <a class="linkcolor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Authority_for_Television_and_Radio" target="_blank"> The Second Authority for Television and Radio.</a>
<br>Due to Israel being a country with diffrent communities and each one with thier tastes and even languages, there are many stations with a specific targeted audience in mind. </p>

Radio provides localized, round-the-clock information and entertainment via friendly neighborhood voices so in theory, it’s the perfect platform in a global crisis that forces hundreds of millions of people to stay home.
<br>
However,many were shocked by sudden job losses as COVID-19 has spread across the globe. Why is terrestrial radio missing the opportunity here — and how should it be fighting to get back on top?

    <p class="ridge" ><small><i>Radio HaKatze is one of the biggest internet radio is israel, based in Tel Aviv and focuses on music been chose by its guest hosts.</i></small></p>
</div>
<br>
The answer might be the internet. Internet radio is a digital audio service transmitted via the Internet. Broadcasting on the Internet is usually referred to as webcasting since it is not transmitted broadly through wireless means.
<br>
Internet radio services offer news, sports, talk, and various genres of music—every format that is available on traditional broadcast radio stations. Many Internet radio services are associated with a corresponding traditional radio station, although low start-up and ongoing costs have allowed a substantial proliferation of independent Internet-only radio stations.
<br>
There are many internet radio stations in the world and in Israel, some being operated from homes with compactic setup and few people while others has a staff of people maintaing it.
